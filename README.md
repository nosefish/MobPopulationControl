Some servers have plugins that allow players to harvest mob spawners and to place and set them later. This feature is frequently used to build "XP-grinders" that collect a huge number of mobs in a confined space, where they can be killed easily to gain experience points. This huge amount of mobs can cause even powerful servers to lag.

MobPopulationControl tries to solve this problem by checking for accumulations of mobs regularly and killing them off.
